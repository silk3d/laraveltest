        <div id="indication"><h4>INDICATION</h4>
            <p>OPSUMIT is an endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) indicated for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH, WHO Group I) to delay disease progression. Disease progression included: death, initiation of intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous prostanoids, or clinical worsening of PAH (decreased 6-minute walk distance, worsened PAH symptoms and need for additional PAH treatment). OPSUMIT also reduced hospitalization for PAH.</p>
            <p>Effectiveness was established in a long-term study in PAH patients with predominantly WHO Functional Class II-III symptoms treated for an average of 2 years. Patients were treated with OPSUMIT monotherapy or in combination with phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors or inhaled prostanoids. Patients had idiopathic and heritable PAH (57%), PAH caused by connective tissue disorders (31%), and PAH caused by congenital heart disease with repaired shunts (8%).</p>

        <div id="isi_content">
            <h4>CONTRAINDICATIONS</h4>Pregnancy: OPSUMIT may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. OPSUMIT is contraindicated in females who are pregnant. If OPSUMIT is used during pregnancy, apprise the patient of the potential hazard to a fetus.
            <h4>WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS</h4>
            <h4>Embryo-fetal Toxicity and OPSUMIT REMS Program </h4> Due to the risk of embryo-fetal toxicity, OPSUMIT is available for females only through a restricted program called the OPSUMIT REMS Program. For females of reproductive potential, exclude pregnancy prior to initiation of therapy, ensure use of acceptable contraceptive methods, and obtain monthly pregnancy tests.
            Notable requirements of the OPSUMIT REMS Program include:
            <ul>
                <li><span class="li_block">■</span>Prescribers must be certified with the program by enrolling and completing training.</li>
                <li><span class="li_block">■</span>All females, regardless of reproductive potential, must enroll in the OPSUMIT REMS Program prior to initiating OPSUMIT.  Male patients are not enrolled in the REMS.</li>
                <li><span class="li_block">■</span>Females of reproductive potential must comply with the pregnancy testing and contraception requirements.</li>
                <li><span class="li_block">■</span>Pharmacies must be certified with the program and must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive OPSUMIT.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Hepatotoxicity</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="li_block">■</span>Other ERAs have caused elevations ofaminotransferases, hepatotoxicity, and liver failure. The incidence of elevated aminotransferases in the SERAPHIN study >3 × ULN was 3.4% for OPSUMIT vs 4.5% for placebo, and >8 × ULN was 2.1% vs 0.4%, respectively. Discontinuations for hepatic adverse events were 3.3% for OPSUMIT vs 1.6% for placebo.</li>
                    <li><span class="li_block">■</span>Obtain liver enzyme tests prior to initiation of OPSUMIT and repeat during treatment as clinically indicated.</li>
                    <li><span class="li_block">■</span>Advise patients to report symptoms suggesting hepatic injury (nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain, fatigue, anorexia, jaundice, dark  urine, fever, or itching).</li>
                    <li><span class="li_block">■</span>If clinically relevant aminotransferase elevations occur, or if elevations are accompanied by an increase in bilirubin >2 × ULN, or by clinical symptoms of hepatotoxicity, discontinue OPSUMIT. Consider re-initiation of OPSUMIT when hepatic enzyme levels normalize in patients who have not experienced clinical symptoms of hepatotoxicity.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Hemoglobin Decrease</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li><span class="li_block">■</span>Decreases in hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit have occurred following administration of other ERAs and in clinical studies       with OPSUMIT. These decreases occurred early and stabilized thereafter</li>
                    <li><span class="li_block">■</span>In the SERAPHIN study, OPSUMIT caused a  mean decrease in hemoglobin (from baseline to 18 months) of about 1.0 g/dL vs no change       in the placebo group. A decrease in hemoglobin to below 10.0 g/dL was reported in 8.7% of the OPSUMIT group vs 3.4% for placebo.     Decreases in hemoglobin seldom require transfusion.</li>
                    <li><span class="li_block">■</span>Initiation of OPSUMIT is not recommended in patients with severe anemia. Measure hemoglobin prior to initiation of treatment and repeat during treatment as clinically indicated.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Pulmonary Edema with Pulmonary Veno-occlusive Disease (PVOD)</h4>
                Should signs of pulmonary edema occur, consider the possibility of associated PVOD. If confirmed, discontinue OPSUMIT.

                <h4>Decreased Sperm Counts</h4>
                Other ERAs have caused adverse effects on spermatogenesis. Counsel men about potential effects on fertility.

                <h4>ADVERSE REACTIONS</h4>
                Most common adverse reactions (more frequent than placebo by ≥3%) were anemia (13% vs 3%), nasopharyngitis/pharyngitis (20% vs 13%), bronchitis (12% vs 6%), headache (14% vs 9%), influenza (6% vs 2%), and urinary tract infection (9% vs 6%).

                <h4>DRUG INTERACTIONS</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="li_block">■</span>Strong inducers of CYP3A4 such as rifampin significantly reduce macitentan exposure. Concomitant use of OPSUMIT with strong CYP3A4     inducers should be avoided.
                <li><span class="li_block">■</span>Strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 like ketoconazole approximately double macitentan exposure. Many HIV drugs like ritonavir are strong inhibitors of  CYP3A4. Avoid concomitant use of OPSUMIT with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. Use other PAH treatment options when strong CYP3A4 inhibitors are needed as part of HIV treatment. Please see full Prescribing Information, including BOXED WARNING for embryo-fetal toxicity.

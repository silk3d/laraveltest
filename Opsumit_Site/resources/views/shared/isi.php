<h2>What is OPSUMIT?</h2>

OPSUMIT is a prescription medicine used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH, WHO Group 1). PAH is high blood pressure in the arteries of your lungs. OPSUMIT can:
Improve your ability to exercise as measured by the 6-minute walk distance (6MWD). In a clinical study of mainly WHO FC II-III patients, those taking OPSUMIT walked, on average, 22 meters farther at Month 6 than patients not taking it
Improve some of your symptoms
Help slow down the progression of your disease. Disease progression included the need for injectable PAH medication or other worsening of PAH (decreased 6MWD, PAH symptoms getting worse, and the need for new PAH treatment)
Lower your chance of being hospitalized for PAH
It is not known if OPSUMIT is safe and effective in children.

OPSUMIT can cause serious birth defects if taken during pregnancy.
Females must not be pregnant when starting OPSUMIT or get pregnant while taking OPSUMIT
Females who are able to get pregnant must have a negative pregnancy test before starting OPSUMIT, each month while taking OPSUMIT, and for 1 month after stopping OPSUMIT. Talk to your healthcare provider about your menstrual cycle. Your healthcare provider will decide when to do the pregnancy tests
Females who are able to get pregnant are females who have entered puberty, even if they have not started their period, and have a uterus, and have not gone through menopause (defined as not having had a period for at least 12 months for natural reasons, or having had ovaries removed)
Females who are not able to get pregnant are females who have not yet entered puberty, or do not have a uterus, or have gone through menopause (defined as not having had a period for at least 12 months for natural reasons, or having had ovaries removed)
Females who are able to get pregnant must use 2 acceptable forms of birth control during treatment with OPSUMIT and for 1 month after stopping OPSUMIT because the medicine may still be in the body. Females who have had a tubal sterilization, a progesterone implant, or have an IUD (intrauterine device) can use these methods alone without any other form of birth control.
Talk with your healthcare provider to find out about options for acceptable birth control that you may use to prevent pregnancy during treatment with OPSUMIT.
See the OPSUMIT Medication Guide for acceptable birth control options
Do not have unprotected sex. Talk to your healthcare provider or pharmacist right away if you have unprotected sex or if you think your birth control has failed. Your healthcare provider may talk with you about using emergency birth control
Tell your healthcare provider right away if you miss a menstrual period or think you may be pregnant for any reason

If you are the parent or caregiver of a female child who started taking OPSUMIT before reaching puberty, you should check your child regularly to see if she is developing signs of puberty. Your child may reach puberty before having her first menstrual period. Talk to your healthcare provider if you think your child is developing signs of puberty or if you have any questions about the signs of puberty.


Females can only receive OPSUMIT through a restricted program called the OPSUMIT Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Program. If you are a female who can get pregnant, you must talk to your healthcare provider, understand the benefits and risks of OPSUMIT, and agree to all of the instructions in the OPSUMIT REMS Program.


Males can receive OPSUMIT without taking part in the OPSUMIT REMS Program.
